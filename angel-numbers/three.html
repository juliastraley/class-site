            Number 3 is the essence of the Trinity - mind, body, spirit.<br><br> It is the threefold nature of divinity. The number 3 symbolizes the principle of 'growth'.<br><br> 3 signifies that there is a synthesis present – that imagination and an outpouring of energy is in action. <br><br>3 represents the principle of increase, expansion, growth and abundance on the physical, emotional, mental, financial and spiritual levels.<br><br>

            3 can signify a goddess’s presence, especially when the 3 follows a 1 in a 13 arrangement. This is because 13 relates to the annual number of moon cycles, and the moon is associated with feminine spirituality.<br><br>

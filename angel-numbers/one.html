          <div class="info">1, being the number of 'new' is the number <br>from which all<br> manifestation begins.<br><br>
            &nbsp;

            It is the energy that begins all actions and leads the way in new directions. 1 is the number of new projects, courage, originality and decisiveness and the desire for expansion on all levels.<br><br>
            &nbsp;

Every number is divisible by 1. We are all one, therefore we are all connected and associated by thought. Watch your thoughts, and focus on your positive desires, rather than your<br> negative fears.<br><br>
&nbsp;

When 1’s appear repeatedly it signifies that an energetic gateway has opened up for you, and this will rapidly manifest your thoughts into reality. <br><br>The message is to choose your thoughts wisely, ensuring that they match your true desires. <br><br>Do not put your energy into focusing on fears – you may manifest them into your life.<br><br>
&nbsp;

The number 11 is a ‘karmic’, Master number. The essence of 11 is developing intuition, clairvoyance, spiritual healing and metaphysical faculties. <br><br>When 11 appears repeatedly in your life, your angels are asking you to pay attention to your repetitive thoughts and ideas, as they hold the ‘answers’ to your prayers.<br><br>
&nbsp;

When you recognise a 1111 sequence appearing to you frequently, take note of your thoughts at the time when they occur. <br><br>When a series of 1111's appear, make sure you monitor your thoughts carefully and be sure to only think about what it is you really want, not what you don't want.<br><br>
&nbsp;

This number sequence is a sign that there is an opportunity opening up for you, and your thoughts are manifesting them into form at lightening speed. The 1111 is similar to the bright light of a flashbulb.
<br><br>It means that the Universe has just taken a snapshot of your thoughts, and is manifesting your ideas into material form.
Be aware that you will manifest your thoughts, therefore, do not think negative thoughts as these are what you will draw into your life.<br><br>
&nbsp;

Use the positive energies of the Universe to bring to fruition your deepest desires, hopes and dreams.</div>

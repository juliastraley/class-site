            The number 9 is the number of completion <br>and of endings.<br><br>
  When 9’s appear repeatedly, it is a message that your ‘Life Purpose’ involves the giving of service through your natural skills, talents, interests and passions. <br><br>9’s indicate that it is a <br>time to end a phase or relationship in your life which is no longer serving you. Do not fear ‘loss’ as ‘new’ will enter your life. <br><br>You have lots of work to do in the future, <br>so prepare yourself.<br><br>
  The number sequence 999 is indicating that the world needs your Divine Life Purpose at this time. Fully embark upon your sacred mission without hesitation or delay. Now is the time for you to realize your true light and purpose and to put them into practice.<br><br> You are asked to live your life in a positive and uplifting manner, in order to teach others by example.<br><br> You are a torchbearer for others and the angels ask you to live up to your full potential for the benefit of all. 999 is a message to ‘Lightworkers’ to keep their light shining brightly.<br><br>

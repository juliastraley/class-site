      <p><b>Recommended by Alison Goldfrapp:</b></p>
      <p>I’m not sure that I have any specific recommendations, but it’s really important for me to be in nature. I find it really healing and also creatively inspiring. I read a lot and see lots of films. As the world becomes more absurd and scary, the more I crave being in the presence of art. Looking at art, making art, being creative—all of these things are more important than ever. That’s what I always come back to. Art is a lifeline for all of us. And I’m not talking about escapism—that word actually kind of annoys me—because I don’t think looking at art or watching a really beautiful film is escapism. Art helps us connect very deeply to these parts of ourselves that we tend to ignore or overlook sometimes. It’s mind expanding and heart expanding and soul expanding and it keeps us all connected. So yeah, that’s what I always come back to when I need to be inspired. Go outside. Go be with some art. <i>Then go make some art.</i></p>
